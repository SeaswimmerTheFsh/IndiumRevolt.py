# IndiumRevolt.py

IndiumRevolt.py aims to recreate functionality of other popular bots from Discord, but on Revolt.
The bot is not currently available to invite, but you can selfhost it below!

## Selfhosting

If you're self-hosting IndiumRevolt.py, please make it clear that it is not the main instance (or change the name) but give credit by linking to this repo (for example, in the bot's profile - something like ``This bot <is based on/is an instance of> [IndiumRevolt.py](https://github.com/SeaswimmerTheFsh/IndiumRevolt.py)`` will suffice).

* Clone this repository (`git clone https://github.com/SeaswimmerTheFsh/IndiumRevolt.py.git`)
* Install Revolt.py and dotenv
  * ``pip install revolt.py dotenv``
* Set up an `.env` file
  * Rename the `.env.example` file and fill out the values
* Run the bot (`python main.py`)
