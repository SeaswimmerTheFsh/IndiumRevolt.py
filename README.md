# IndiumRevolt.py

IndiumRevolt.py aims to recreate functionality of other popular bots from Discord, but on Revolt.
The bot is not currently available to invite, but there are instructions on how to self-host the bot below!

## Self-hosting

If you're self-hosting IndiumRevolt.py, please make it clear that it is not the main instance (or change the name) but give credit by linking to this repository in the bot's profile (something like ``This bot is an instance of [IndiumRevolt.py](https://github.com/SeaswimmerTheFsh/IndiumRevolt.py)`` will suffice).

* Clone this repository (`git clone https://github.com/SeaswimmerTheFsh/IndiumRevolt.py.git`)
* Install Revolt.py and python-dotenv
  * ``pip install revolt.py pytimeparse2 python-dotenv``
* Set up an `.env` file
  * Rename the `.env.example` file and fill out the values
* Run the bot (`python main.py`)
